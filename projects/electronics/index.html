      <h2><u>Testing Equipment</u></h2>
      <p>This is my favorite thing to build. From industrial relay testers, light bar testers, simple continuity testers, adapters, power supplies, and more!</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <!--<h3><a href="/relay_tester">Relay Tester</a></h3>-->
            <h3><a href="/construction.html">Relay Tester <img class="construction" src="/images/buttons/lockout.png"></a></h3>
            <p>Back when I was working in a more... frugal... industrial environment (let's call them PP), my bosses went the cheap route on everything, including buying (possibly) used relays off of ebay and various industrial auctions. This board was to be used as a tester to figure out if the relays we got were still funcional. Even though I don't work there anymore, I still would like to complete the project as it was kind of a neat little thing.<p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <!--<h3><a href="/pan_power">120VAC/24VDC power supply</a></h3>-->
            <h3><a href="pan_power/">120VAC/24VDC power supply</a></h3>
            <p>Another PP special. I needed an easy way to get 120VAC and 24VDC for testing purposes while I was fixing control circuitry for the machines. This is nothing more than a housing, a couple indicators, and some switches I was able to mount to my rolling tool cart. Simple project, but it was fun creating the houses out of the materials we had lying around in scrap bins.</p>

      <h2><u>Teaching Old Hardware New Tricks</u></h2>
      <p>Another of my favorite categories. I love taking old stuff that either doesn't work or is a problem we have more modern solutions for and giving them new life. Adding USB connections to things that were invented before USB, improving the computing power of old calculators, or turning the broken husk of something that doesn't work into something it never dreamed it could be!</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <!--<h3><a href="/old_keyboard">This Old Keyboard</a></h3>-->
            <h3><a href="/construction.html">This Old Keyboard <img class="construction" src="/images/buttons/lockout.png"></a></h3>
            <p>Taking an old console keyboard and turning it either into a PS/2 or USB keyboard. More details of the process and a little history of the machine it was connected to.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      <hr><!--=============================================-->
      <h2><u>Low-Level Learning</u></h2>
      <p>Little builds I use to learn and understand more about what makes the electronics around us tick</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <!--<h3><a href="/555_circuits">555 Clock Circuits</a></h3>-->
            <h3><a href="/construction.html">555 Clock Circuits <img class="construction" src="/images/buttons/lockout.png"></a></h3>
            <p>How does a 555 timer work and what can it be used for? Sure wish my low-voltage teacher at my technical school told me! Guess I'll just have to find out myself!</p>
          </li>
