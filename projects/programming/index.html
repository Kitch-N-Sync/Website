      <h2><u>This Website!</u></h2>
      <p>That's right, this site is a project in and of itself. I am not a web coder, my specialties are both in automating boring stuff I have to do at work by bodging together a bunch of different programs in whatever language it gets done. My HTML code reflects that. I'll try and put some updates here about the stuff I learn programming the HTML and CSS for this website!</p>
