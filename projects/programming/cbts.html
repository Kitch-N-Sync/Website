      <h1>Computer Based Trainings (CBT's)</h1>
      <p>Information on the inner workings of all those trainings your business makes you take online as well as some automation to make it easier on you!

      <h3>What is a CBT?</h3>
        <p>A CBT, or computer-based training, is a training you take on the computer!</p>
        <p>Yeah, yeah. A CBT is what happens when companies want to be able to state that their employees were trained on certain aspects of the job they'll be doing, whether it be safety or procedure, but want to make sure that information is standardized for each employee.</p>
        <p>There are more reasons why a company would decide to do CBTs instead of direct training or classroom setting. They may not have the space to do so. They may have either not enough staff or too many people who need the training to have a decent ratio. CBTs are also a quick and dirty CYA for the company so if anything bad happens, the employee can't blame the company for not instructing them on what they were supposed to do. "See? You took the training, it's on your file."</p>
        <p>Now I'm not saying all CBTs are bad or useless. I've had many CBTs I've learned good info from and I try to take notes just as I'd do in an online class so I can refer to this stuff later on. It also gives you a good baseline. You might not remember the information, but you know where to go to get it and every time it comes up it solidifies that info in your mind.</p>
        <p>Speaking of online classes, especially with the whole COVID thing, a lot of people learned that they just aren't good at taking online courses. Hopefully there should some stuff in here to help out with that.</p>

      <h3>What are we trying to do here?</h3>
        <p>I have a few goals that I want from this program.<br>It should:<p>
        <ul>
          <li>be able to be used on a computer with no admin privileges</li>
          <li>be as universal as possible.</li>
          <li>take the information from the CBT and save it to a text document.</li>
          <li>automatically click the next slide button whenever it is available to press</li>
          <li>be able to be paused so if I have to do something, it won't keep clicking the next button</li>
          <li>(optional) take and store the quiz questions/answers (My reason behind this is I've noticed sometimes the quiz question information is not explicitly stated in the main slides or is worded differently. Also so we can cheat on the final test if we need to, I'm not here to discuss ethics.)
        </ul>

      <h3>Caveats and Workarounds</h3>
        <p>This is a personal project to solve a single problem in whatever way I can. I am in no way a professional programmer, and if you have suggestions email me at <a href="mailto:kitchnsync.sinkmail@gmail.com">kitchnsync.sinkmail@gmail.com</a>. I love learning things!</p>
        <p>This being a complete bodge project (like most of my programming) I don't have much to work with. It's a work computer so I can't install anything on it. What I <em>can</em> do is install something to a USB at home, copy it to the computer from the USB, and run it on the computer.</p>
        <p>So what I did was install VIM and AutoHotKey to a flash drive and copy those onto the computer (after finding out that you can't run executables off of USB's but you can copy them to your desktop and fire them up from there.)</p>
        <img src="/images/dr_evil_security.png" alt="Doctor Evil from Austin Powers making air quotes with the text security at the bottom">
        <p>I would love to make a program that is some sort of web scraper for getting all the text off of the site source codes (or to somehow just save the source codes directly to a file) but I'm still figuring out how to do that.</p>
      <h3>The Files</h3>
        <p>Due to having a free account on neocities, I have to upload them as "filepath.extension.txt" so you'll have to remove the .txt extension</p>
        <p>I'm gonna be adding a lot more info on these as well as comment lines in the programs.</p>
